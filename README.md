# yokemup

A simple web app to help estimate yoke or cable straddle heights for cantilever brakes.

## Usage

Open `src/index.html` in any modern web browser. Fill out the form with your
frame, tire width, brake and yoke details. The app will display suggested yoke
heights and an interactive diagram where you can drag the yoke position to see
how the height changes.

The calculation is based on a small set of example data. If a specific
combination is not found, a basic formula is used as a fallback.
